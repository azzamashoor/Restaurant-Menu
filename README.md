This code implements a static, responsive restaurant menu webpage using semantic HTML5 elements and internal CSS for layout and styling. The structure leverages <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> tags to organize content logically, while anchor links with fragment identifiers enable in-page navigation. A global CSS reset is applied using the universal selector to normalize margin, padding, and box-sizing, ensuring consistent rendering across browsers. Layout for the appetizer items is handled with Flexbox (display: flex, gap, and flex-wrap) to create a flexible, wrapping card grid. Each .card component uses box-shadow, border-radius, and transition properties, combined with a transform: scale() hover effect for interactive UI feedback. Images are controlled using fixed height and object-fit: cover to maintain aspect ratio and prevent distortion. The pricing section uses a styled HTML table with border-collapse and custom header formatting. A media query at max-width: 768px modifies layout behavior (centering flex items and expanding table width to 100%) to ensure responsiveness on smaller devices, making the design adaptive and mobile-friendly.
